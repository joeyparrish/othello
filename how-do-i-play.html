    <h2>How do I play?</h2>
    <p>
      You take turns placing stones on the squares of the board.  You may only
      play a stone that captures some of the other player's stones.  A stone is
      captured if there is one or more opponent's stone between your new play
      and another stone of yours.  The captured stones flip over to show the
      opposite color.  For example:
    </p>
    <div id="exampleBoard">
      <div class="square stone-container valid"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container white"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container white"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container white"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container black"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container white"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container black"></div>
      <div class="square stone-container"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In this example, is it black's turn.  The square on the left is a valid
      move, and is marked with a small gray dot.  The square on the right is
      not a valid move, because it doesn't border any white stones and would
      not capture anything.  If black plays on the left, the three white stones
      on the left would be captured and become black.  The white stone in the
      middle would not be captured, because the capture stops at the first
      black stone.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you cannot capture any of the other player's stones, you must pass.
      The app will determine this for you and give control back to the other
      player after showing this on your part of the score board:
      <span class="stone-container white turn pass">
        <span class="msg-container"></span>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      When the board is full, the game is over.  The player with the most
      stones wins.  The app will show this on the score board for the winner:
      <span class="stone-container black win">
        <span class="msg-container"></span>
      </span>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can start the game over at any time using the "Reset Game" button at
      the bottom.
    </p>

    <h3>Playing locally</h3>
    <p>
      To play locally, two players take turns clicking or tapping on the same
      device to make their moves.  This works really well with a tablet or
      phone laying on the table between two players, but can also be done on a
      laptop or desktop with a mouse.
    </p>

    <h3>Playing offline</h3>
    <p>
      To play offline, just load the URL.  If you've loaded it before, it
      should be cached and available offline.  On some platforms, such as
      Android, you may also be prompted to install the app to your home screen.
    </p>

    <h3>Playing with a friend over the internet</h3>
    <p>
      To play over the internet, click or tap on the "P2P Multi-player" button
      at the bottom of the screen.  A video chat will appear under or to the
      right of the game board.  Click or tap on the text under "Your ID" to
      copy it to the clipboard.  Send this text to a friend.  Your friend then
      pastes your ID into the field labelled "Your friend's ID" and hits enter
      on the keyboard or tablet/phone's on-screen keyboard.  This will start
      the connection between you and your friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the game, you can see and talk to your friend while you play.
      There is a mute button which can be used to mute or unmute the connection.
      You can use the "X" button on the video chat to end the connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it's your turn, your color will have a halo behind it at the top of
      the scoreboard, and all valid moves will be marked for you with a gray
      dot.  Either player can use the "Reset Game" button at the bottom of the
      board at any time to start a new game.
    </p>

    <h3>Match-making</h3>
    <p>
      This game is meant to be social and played with friends and family.  It
      is not meant as a way to meet internet trolls, so there is no
      match-making service.  You'll have to send your randomly-generated ID to
      others using some other system, like a text message, chat, or email.
    </p>

    <h2>Browser support</h2>

      This probably won't work on IE.  It should work on any <i>current</i>
      browser.  If it doesn't work for you, please file a new issue here:
